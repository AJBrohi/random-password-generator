# Random Password Generator

This Python program generates a random password according to the user's choice of combinations. The user can choose the length and types of characters for their password to create a strong and secure password.

The user can select from four different combinations when generating a password. Combinations are:

1. [Only Letters and Numbers](#ln "Goto Only Letters and Numbers")
2. [Only Letters and Symbol](#ls "Goto Only Letters and Symbol")
3. [Only Numbers and Symbol](#ns "Goto Only Numbers and Symbol")
4. [Letters, Numbers and Symbol](#lns "Goto Letters, Numbers and Symbol")
